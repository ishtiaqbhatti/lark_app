# Step 6: Strategic Blueprint Assembly and Outline Generation Weaknesses

1.  **Arbitrary Word Count Calculation:** `BriefAssembler.py` calculates the `target_word_count` using a fixed base and a hardcoded multiplier, rather than competitor data.
2.  **Non-Data-Driven Content Length:** This approach results in arbitrary content length targets that are not strategically informed by the current SERP landscape.
3.  **Ignores Competitor Word Counts:** The system fails to use the `average_word_count` of top-ranking competitors, a valuable metric calculated in Step 4.
4.  **Missed Strategic Basis for Length:** This is a missed opportunity to base a key content metric on real-world, data-driven insights.
5.  **Underutilization of Analysis Data:** The word count logic fails to make use of valuable data generated by the Metric Analyzer in the previous step.
6.  **Restrictive Outline Customization:** The `ContentBlueprint.jsx` component only allows users to add PAA questions to the final "Frequently Asked Questions" section.
7.  **Inability to Strategically Place PAA:** Users cannot strategically integrate high-priority PAA questions into the main body of the article where they might be more effective.
8.  **Poor User Experience:** The limited outline customization feature provides a poor and frustrating user experience for content strategists.
9.  **Lack of Source Citation Mandate:** The system identifies authoritative sources (`ai_overview_sources`) in Step 5 but fails to mandate their citation in the final content.
10. **Generalized Tactical Guidance:** Instead of enforcing the use of identified sources, the system only offers generalized tactical guidance, reducing the content's authority.
